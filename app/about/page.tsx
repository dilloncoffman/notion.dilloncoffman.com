      <p className="text-base sm:text-xl">
        Thanks for checking out my site. This site is a conglomeration of all
        things me. Here you&apos;ll find everything from my thoughts on tech and
        philosophy to little songs and covers I&apos;ve made. Ever since I was
        little I&apos;ve been playing guitar (yes, the Fisher-Price piece of
        plastic with buttons and sounds totally counts!) and find myself most at
        ease when listening to or playing music. You could say music is my.. ...
        jam. Sorry about that.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base sm:text-xl">
        In 2022 I took up leathercraft &amp; began creating all kinds of things
        from wallets to watch straps for family &amp; friends. It wasn&apos;t
        too far into the year when I decided to spin up{" "}
        <Link href="https://www.instagram.com/dillonsleatherco/" noopener>
          Dillon&apos;s Leather Co.
        </Link>{" "}
        to share my work with others. Don&apos;t hesitate to reach out if
        you&apos;re looking for a rad new wallet or pencil case ðŸ˜Ž

      <p className="text-base sm:text-xl">
        Outside of music and leathercraft, I find myself hacking on side
        projects. In the past I&apos;ve helped a local nonprofit by building
        them an{" "}
        <Link href="https://walk-our-watershed.netlify.app/" noopener>
          event website
        </Link>{" "}
        to raise money and get our community active during COVID-19. Currently
        I&apos;m exploring projects integrating with new AI tech like{" "}
        <Link href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2" noopener>
          DALLÂ·E 2
        </Link>
        . Thanks to University, a couple rad internships, a cool job and an
        insatiable curiosity, I&apos;ve had the opportunity to work with all
        kinds of technology. From writing C programs to developing Android
        applications to building web apps in the cloud, you can find it all on{" "}
